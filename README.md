## Final Project for COGS118A: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This is a project conducted for COGS118A at UCSD, FA23.

### Abstract:
As machine learning continues to shape data-driven decision-making, the demand and need for understanding and harnessing diverse classification algorithms has 
grown exponentially. This paper seeks to help address the gap in comprehensive empirical studies by presenting an in-depth study and comparison of three supervised 
learning algorithms: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors. The evaluation focuses on average performance accuracy across diverse problems and datasets and trials.
